# Reference parts

Parts with expected values worked out independently of cadrs, rebuilt through cadrs' feature
list by `tests/reference_parts.rs` and compared (issue #101). The results table is
`docs/reference-parts.md`.

## `solidcraft/`

The reference cases of [SolidCraft](https://github.com/tangency-labs/solidcraft)
(`tests/oracle/`, at commit `0870d6474a87a2cc03707080f848cfd81017f943`), copied unchanged:
each case's `recipe.json` (the part, in SolidCraft's recipe format) and `expected.json` (what
it must measure: closed-form values, or values from an independent FreeCAD build, as its
`source` says). Their `reference.stl` files are not copied yet. Copyright (c) 2026 SolidCraft
contributors, used under the MIT License (`solidcraft/LICENSE-MIT`); SolidCraft is also
available under the Apache License 2.0.

The recipe format and its conventions are described in SolidCraft's `tests/oracle/README.md`.
The translation into cadrs features follows SolidCraft's own reader
(`apps/solidcraft-cli/src/recipe.rs`) for what the format means, and its comparison rules
(`apps/solidcraft-cli/src/oracle.rs`): volume and area within a relative 1e-3 unless a case
says otherwise, centre of mass and bounding box within 1e-3 of the bounding box's diagonal,
face counts where given, and a STEP export read back with the same volume and area. cadrs
also checks the mesh it draws: each face's triangles cover its exact area within 1e-2.

## Running

Each case is a test of its own, named after its folder (`case_49_helical_sweep` for
`49-helical-sweep/`), so one case or a few run by name:

```sh
cargo test -r -p cadrs_core --test reference_parts -- helical
```

A case copied in needs its line in the test file's `cases!` list; `every_case_has_a_test`
fails until it has one.

## Updating the passing list

`passing.txt` lists the cases cadrs passes; the test fails if one of them stops passing. After
a change that makes more cases pass, record them with:

```sh
CADRS_BLESS=1 cargo test -r -p cadrs_core --test reference_parts
```

which also rewrites `docs/reference-parts.md`.
