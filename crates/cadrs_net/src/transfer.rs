//! Asking a peer about a shared document: one QUIC stream, dialled to the peer's key, on an
//! ALPN of our own (bevy_iroh's direct messages stop at a megabyte; a document, or an edit
//! that pastes one in, need not).
//!
//! Of the owner:
//! - **Join**: the document as it is now ([`Welcome`]: the access granted, the edit it is at,
//!   the document).
//! - **Propose**: an edit to number ([`Verdict`]). One at a time per peer, so they arrive in
//!   the order they were made; the numbered edit itself reaches everyone over the room.
//! - **AddMember**: share the document with someone else (for a member who may share).
//! - **Leave**: "Unshare with me".
//!
//! Of anyone: **Invite**, the owner telling someone the document is shared with them (and its
//! link, again whenever the room changes).
//!
//! Every request names the document and the room's topic, which only a holder of the link
//! knows. The app decides ([`Requests`]).
